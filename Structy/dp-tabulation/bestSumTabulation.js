// Write a fn "bestSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as args.
// The fn should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.
// If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.

const bestSum = (targetSum, numbers) => {};
console.log('Output: 7', bestSum(7, [5, 4, 7, 3])); // [7]
console.log('Output: [3,5]', bestSum(8, [5, 2, 3])); // [3,5]
console.log('Output: [4,4]', bestSum(8, [1, 4, 5])); // [4,4]
console.log('Output: [25x4]', bestSum(100, [1, 2, 5, 25])); // [25, 25, 25, 25]
