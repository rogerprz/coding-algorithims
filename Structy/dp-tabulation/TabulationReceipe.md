# Tabulation recipe

- Visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on the inputs
  - fib of n, requires an array or 1d
  - grid problem, 2d required
- Initialize the table with default values
  - if it's asking you to return a number, then setting your table with numbers would be the way to go
  - if it asks you to return a boolean, then setup your table with true/false
  - for strings, use true, false if it is valid scenario. (Double check this )
- Seed the trivial answer in the table
  - AKA create table and fill in with default data
- Fill further positions based on the current position
