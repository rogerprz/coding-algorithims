# Dynamic Programming

It is an optimization technique used to solve problems that are too difficult to solve directly.

If you have something you can cache you can use dynamic programming

- Way to solve problems by breaking it down into subproblems that can be used next time you need it.

Caching

- As a backpack to school. You have a small box on oyur back so that you can use them over and over.
- Used to speed up programs
- Memoization is a specific form of caching used in Dynamic programming

## Think of Dynamic Programming as:

- Divide and Conquer + Memoization

### Steps to follow:

1. Can the problem be divided into subproblems?
2. Does it have a recursive solution?
3. Are there repetitive subproblems?
4. If yes, we can memoize the subproblems
5. Demand a raise from your boss.

You need to know when you're able to use this type of problem.
