# Dynamic Programming

It is an optimization technique used to solve problems that are too difficult to solve directly.

If you have something you can cache you can use dynamic programming

- Way to solve problems by breaking it down into subproblems that can be used next time you need it.

Caching

- As a backpack to school. You have a small box on oyur back so that you can use them over and over.
- Used to speed up programs
