## Array

## Hash Tables

- Scattered over memory

## LinkedLIst

### Why LinkedList?

| Pros           | Cons        |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Fast insertion | Slow lookup |
| Fast Deletion  | More Memory |
| Ordered        |             |
| Flexible Size  |             |

- It has a lose structure
- Insert and delete operations are O(1)
- Order is compared to hash tables

Big O notation:

- prepend O(1)
- append O(1)
- lookup O(n)
- insert O(n)
- delete O(n)

## Stacks

- Can only be pop()
- Has LIFO (Last In First Out)

Big O notation:

- lookup O(n)
- pop O(1)
- push O(1)
- peek O(1)

## Queues

- Like a rollercoaster ride, First In First Out (FIFO)

Big O notation:

- lookup O(n)
- enqueue O(1)
- dequeue O(1)
- peek O(1)

// ... 9
// ..4 .. 20
// 1 .6 15 170

## Graphs

### Types of Graphs

- Directed
  - Goes usually in one direction
  - Twitter can follow but they don't need to follow you
- Undirected
  - Can go back and forth
  - Facebook is
- Weighted
  - Optimal path such as maps
- Unweighted
- Cyclic
  - Can go in a loop
- Acyclic
  - Do not go in a loop
